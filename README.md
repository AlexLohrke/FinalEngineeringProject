# FinalEngineeringProject
My final project for First Year Purdue Engineering. We had to create a program that took an input, 
had three sub-functions, a for loop, a while loop, an if statement, and 100 lines of code.

We could make the project about anything we wanted, and since I'm interested in aerospace 
and space in general, I decided to make a planet identifier code.

The user puts in the temperature, composition (solid or gas), and gravity of a planet and the code identifies it.

In this project, the planet_project file is the main one, and the other three are sub-functions, so if you wish 
to test it, put the inputs in the planet_project first, or it will cause an error.
